Privileged Accounts
-------------------

SIMP systems require a password when the system enters single user mode.
In the event system maintenance needs to be performed at the system console,
users must have the ``root`` password to be
authenticated. Grub passwords are also set to prevent unauthorized
modifications to boot parameters.
