Flaw Remediation
-----------------

The :term:`Yellowdog Updater, Modified` (YUM) client is configured to point to all SIMP
repositories.  Each night, a cron job runs yum update to install updated
packages on each SIMP client.  Therefore any packages in a repository are
delivered within a 24 hour time period.
