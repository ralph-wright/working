Authenticator Management
---------------------------

The operating system protects locally stored passwords by hashing them.  SIMP
maximizes that protection by using the SHA512 algorithm.

Passwords expire every 180 days, must be at least 1 day old to be changed, and
users are warned 14 days before the password will expire.
