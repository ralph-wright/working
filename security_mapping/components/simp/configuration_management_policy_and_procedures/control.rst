Configuration Management Policy and Procedures
----------------------------------------------

All software developed and delivered under SIMP has a version associated with
it.  The aggregation of those components come together to make up a SIMP
version.  The current installed version of SIMP is written to a local file
``/etc/simp/simp/version``.
