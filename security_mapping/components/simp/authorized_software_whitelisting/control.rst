Authorized Software
--------------------

SIMP builds and configures centralized YUM repositories which are hosted on the
SIMP server.  These repositories host all of the packages that are needed to
install a SIMP server and client.  Additionally, all of the packages available on
a CentOS/RedHat ISO are also placed in a repository.

All of the repositories installed by the SIMP module require packages to the
signed with a known GPG key.
