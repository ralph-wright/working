Device Identification and Authentication
----------------------------------------

There is an account and password setup to authenticate devices needing to
synchronize with the LDAD server.  The username for that account is ``LDAPSync``
and the account and associated password are stored in LDAP.

There is also an account for a device to authenticate prior to being allowed to
do anything else with the LDAP server.  The username for that account is
hostAuth and the account is stored in LDAP.
