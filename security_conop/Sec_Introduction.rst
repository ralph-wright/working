Introduction
============

This manual describes the security concepts of the SIMP system. The
system was originally designed to meet a specific set of technical
security controls using industry best practices and has been modified
recently to meet as many of the security controls provided by the
National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) special
publication `800-53 <http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html>`__
as possible.

This manual outlines three categories of security:

-  **Technical Architecture**: discusses the technical approaches to
   securing the system

-  **Operational Security**: discusses the security of SIMP in an
   operational setting

-  **Information System Management**: discusses how SIMP helps achieve
   security in terms of system management

A brief discussion of how the SIMP system helps achieve categories of
controls is provided; additional technical details regarding each
control can be found in the SIMP Security Controls Traceability Matrix
(SCTM).

When possible, the security control identifier will be found at the end
of a concept to provide the reader with a reference to the specific
control that is being discussed. The identifier is written as [AB-X(Y)],
where A is the control family, X is the control section, and Y is the
control enhancement.
