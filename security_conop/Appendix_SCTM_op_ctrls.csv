CM-2,Baseline Configuration,Configuration Management,"SIMP has strictly enforced version control during development. The baseline files for SIMP are kept and maintained in a git repository. Files are packaged and a series of auto tests are performed on each release. Once released, there is a version number associated for distribution. Additionally, custom puppet modules are in the form of RPMs and have version numbers associated with them. All documentation is also built with source code."

CM-2(5),Baseline Configuration (Control Enhancement),Configuration Management,a. SIMP provides a minimal list of packages and services installed. The minimal list of packages can be found in kickstart files and the appendix of this document. Additional packages are installed by each implementation or as SIMP modules are applied. b. It's not feasible to technically deny additional applications from being installed. There is nothing in SIMP that can stop and RPM from being applied. Applications that require network access to service activation must be registered with puppet.
CM-2(6),Baseline Configuration (Control Enhancement),Configuration Management,"As a project, SIMP is developmental only. The environments where it is tested is up to the implementation. Development testing is performed on SIMP in environments that have a code base frozen."

CM-3(3),Configuration Change Control (Control Enhancement),Configuration Management,"Configuration changes in SIMP are automated using a combination of puppet, yum, and rsync. While not all files on an operating system are managed by those mechanisms, many are. Changes to critical files that are managed by puppet, revert back to their original state. These mechanisms were not meant to defeat an attack by a malicious insider."

CM-4,Security Impact Analysis,Configuration Management,All features or bugs in SIMP are vetted through the development process by being placed on the product backlog and discussed with the entire team. There is a security representative on the SIMP team that is part of that vetting process.

CM-5(3),Access Restrictions for Change (Control Enhancement),Configuration Management,Redhat and Centos packages are signed with gpg keys. Those keys are vendor specific.

CM-5(7),Access Restrictions for Change (Control Enhancement),Configuration Management,"Most of the critical files that are managed by puppet cannot be permanently changed on a puppet client without disabling puppet and rsync. If they are changed, puppet will revert them back to their original state."
CM-6,Configuration Settings,Configuration Management,"Part “d” of this control is met my SIMP. The others are not. SIMP uses puppet to monitor changes to configuration settings. If changes to puppet controlled settings are manually made, they revert back to their original state."
CM-6(1),Configuration Settings (Control Enhancement),Configuration Management,"The puppet master is the central point of management for a SIMP system. While not required, the puppet master usually hosts a kickstart server so that clients are built the same every time."
CM-6(2),Configuration Settings (Control Enhancement),Configuration Management,"Puppet is not intended to be a security mechanism to prevent unauthorized changes to files. For files that are managed by puppet that changed, they will revert back to their original state. This control is really about protecting from unauthorized changes so access control to the puppet master should suffice to meet it. Changes to files are audited using auditd. Puppet changes are also audited. It's up to the implementation to perform altering on those changes."
CM-6(3),Configuration Settings (Control Enhancement),Configuration Management,This control is not fully met by SIMP. It's important to point out that SIMP does provide logging of events to syslog. It's currently up to the implementation to alert on those events.
CM-7,Least Functionality,Configuration Management,"There isn't an explicit list of services that SIMP denies. Instead, it was built to provide only the essential functionality. Additional services get added only as needed."
CM-7(1),Least Functionality (Control Enhancement),Configuration Management,
CM-7(2),Least Functionality (Control Enhancement),Configuration Management,"Applications can be installed, but new services will not run unless first registered with puppet. Additionally, puppet modules must be modified to ensure that IPtables opens up the necessary services. Minimally, for a service to remain active, it must be registered with puppet or the svckill.rb script will stop them.To be clear, there is nothing in SIMP that prevents the installation of RPMs (from the command line or YUM)."

SI-2(1),Flaw Remediation (Control Enhancement),System and Information Integrity,"Patches that are part of the software base for SIMP are tested within the development environment. There is automated testing that is constantly being extended to test more features. There are times that patches to the base operating system (Centos or RedHat) are needed to resolve issues in SIMP. Those are also tested at build time, but require additional testing by implementations as patches are released from vendors. It's also important to note that SIMP is packaged and delivered decoupled with the operating system source files. It's up to the implementation to test vendor specific patches that are not part of the SIMP code base. Flaws are tracked using the software project management tool Redmine."
